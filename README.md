Flacuna was developed by fine-tuning Vicuna on Flan-mini, a comprehensive instruction collection encompassing various tasks. Vicuna is already an excellent writing assistant, and the intention behind Flacuna was to enhance Vicuna's problem-solving capabilities. To achieve this, we curated a dedicated instruction dataset called Flan-mini.

## Problem Solving Ability

As a result of this fine-tuning process, Flacuna exhibited notable performance improvements in problem-solving across multiple benchmark datasets, both in few-shot and zero-shot settings.

| **Model** | **Size** | **MMLU (5-shot)** | **BBH (3-shot)** | **DROP (3-shot)** | **CRASS (3-shot)** | **HumanEval (0-shot)** | **Avg.** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| StableVicuna | 13B | 49.2 (+3.0) | 37.5 (+0.4) | 34.3 (-1.0) | 67.5 (+8.7) | 15.9 (+2.5) | 40.9 (+2.7) |
| Vicuna | 13B | 50.6 (+4.5) | 37.6 (+0.5) | 32.6 (-3.0) | 60.9 (+2.1) | 11.6 (-1.8) | 38.7 (+0.6) |
| Flacuna | 13B | 51.1 (+5.0) | 39.3 (+2.2) | 43.6 (+8.0) | 74.1 (+15.3) | 11.0 (-2.4) | 43.8 (+5.6) |

| **Model** | **Size** | **MMLU (0-shot)** | **BBH (0-shot)** | **CRASS (0-shot)** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| StableVicuna | 13B | 47.5 | 18.5 | 64.2 |
| Vicuna | 13B | 48.3 | 28.3 | 65.7 |
| Flacuna | 13B | 49.4 | 32.5 | 67.9 |


During training, Flacuna is a 13B checkpoint of LLaMA and employed a maximum input sequence length of 1280. We utilized LoRA for parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

## Chatbot / Writing Assistant

While Flacuna primarily excels in problem-solving tasks, we made efforts to maintain the impressive writing and chatting ability of Vicuna. To achieve this, we incorporated conversational datasets generated by GPT-4, such as GPT-4-Alpaca and ShareGPT, into the Flan-mini collection.
To use Flacuna as a chatbot or writing assistant, we recommend you use the following template:

```
A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: {definition of the task}.\n\n
{question}\n
Output: ASSISTANT:

```
**Please note that we still recommend using Vicuna as your preferred Chatbot or Writing Assistant, over Flacuna. Flacuna's primary strength lies in problem-solving tasks, making it ideal for such applications.**

The following table presents the writing performance of Flacuna on the IMPACT dataset, which is a component of the InstructEval evaluation suite. The generated responses have been evaluated by ChatGPT, and their relevance and coherence have been scored on a scale of 1 to 5.


| **Model** | **Size** | **Informative Rel.** | **Informative Coh.** | **Professional Rel.** | **Professional Coh.** | **Argumentative Rel.** | **Argumentative Coh.** | **Creative Rel.** | **Creative Coh.** | **Avg. Rel.** | **Avg. Coh.** |
